[OVERVIEW]

The main objects of this project had three parts. First of all, I should understand what the system call is through this 
project. Second, I had to append more functions in the system call 'open()' given by OS LAB. Last of all, I had to make 
'fcntl()' which is one of the system calls and had to append several functions.
